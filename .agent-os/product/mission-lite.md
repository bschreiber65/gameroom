# Product Mission (Lite)

Codenames is a multiplayer web application for playing Codenames online. Two players take turns giving one-word clues and guessing cards on a 5x5 grid, with real-time gameplay, in-game chat, friend lists, and game invitations.

It serves casual gamers who want a free, browser-based Codenames experience with social features. Unlike barebones alternatives, Codenames provides friend lists with presence tracking, game invitations, per-game chat, and a play-again flow that avoids repeating words - all without requiring a custom server, powered entirely by Supabase Realtime and hosted as a static SPA on Netlify.
